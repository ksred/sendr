# Sender App Cleanup Tasks

This document lists specific tasks for cleaning up and optimizing the Sender App. Tasks are grouped by category and priority.

## Code Cleanup

### High Priority
- [ ] Remove unused imports across all files
- [ ] Clean up console.log statements that aren't needed for debugging
- [ ] Remove commented-out code that's no longer needed
- [ ] Delete any unused component files
- [ ] Remove unused state variables and functions
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate logic in the chat page
- [ ] Standardize API error handling

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Extract repeated UI patterns into shared components
- [ ] Create utility functions for common operations
- [ ] Move hardcoded values to constants
- [ ] Fix any TypeScript 'any' types

## Performance Optimizations

### High Priority
- [ ] Optimize initial loading sequence
- [ ] Fix any unnecessary re-renders in the chat page
- [ ] Add proper loading states for all API calls
- [ ] Improve error handling for failed network requests

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add React.memo() for pure components
- [ ] Implement useCallback() for event handlers passed to children
- [ ] Optimize image loading and display
- [ ] Add lazy loading for components not needed on initial render

## Architecture Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Clean up the API client implementation
- [ ] Improve context providers and reduce prop drilling
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
- [ ] Fix any inconsistent folder structure

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Enhance TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- [ ] Refactor complex components into smaller, focused ones
- [ ] Ensure consistent state management patterns
- [ ] Improve handling of authentication and session state

## UX Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement consistent error states
- [ ] Fix layout issues on mobile devices
- [ ] Ensure accessibility for all interactive elements
- [ ] Standardize loading indicators

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Improve form validation feedback
- [ ] Enhance transitions between states
- [ ] Fix any inconsistent styling
- [ ] Ensure proper keyboard navigation

## Testing & Documentation

### High Priority
- [ ] Document key architectural decisions
- [ ] Add/update comments for complex logic
- [ ] Fix any broken types or interfaces

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add basic unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Document API integration points
- [ ] Update README with setup and contribution instructions

## Implementation Approach

We'll tackle these tasks in the following order:

1. Start with high-priority code cleanup to establish a cleaner foundation
2. Move to high-priority performance optimizations
3. Address high-priority architecture improvements
4. Implement high-priority UX improvements
5. Handle high-priority testing & documentation
6. Work through medium-priority items in the same order

Each task should be implemented as a discrete unit of work with clear acceptance criteria.
