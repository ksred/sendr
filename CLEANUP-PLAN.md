# Sender App Cleanup Implementation Plan

This document outlines our systematic approach to cleaning up and optimizing the Sender App codebase.

## 1. Code Cleanup

### 1.1 Remove Unused Components & Imports
- Scan all files for unused imports
- Remove any dead code paths and commented-out code
- Delete any unused component files
- Clean up unused state variables and functions

### 1.2 Consolidate Duplicate Logic
- Identify repeated code patterns across components
- Extract common functionality into shared utility functions
- Create reusable hooks for shared behaviors

## 2. Performance Optimizations

### 2.1 Rendering Optimizations
- Add React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement useMemo() and useCallback() for expensive calculations/callbacks
- Fix any excessive re-renders in component trees

### 2.2 Data Fetching Improvements
- Optimize data loading patterns to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Implement better error handling and retry strategies
- Improve loading states during API calls

### 2.3 Asset Optimization
- Optimize image loading with proper sizing and formats
- Implement code splitting for larger bundles
- Lazy load components that aren't needed immediately

## 3. Architecture Improvements

### 3.1 State Management
- Audit global state usage and reduce unnecessary state
- Ensure proper context division for different concerns
- Move local state where appropriate

### 3.2 API Layer
- Clean up API client implementation
- Standardize error handling across API calls
- Improve typing for API responses

### 3.3 Type System
- Strengthen TypeScript types throughout the app
- Replace any usage of `any` types with proper interfaces
- Ensure consistent naming conventions for types

## 4. UX Improvements

### 4.1 Loading States
- Implement consistent loading states across all components
- Add skeleton loaders where appropriate
- Ensure proper error states are displayed

### 4.2 Responsive Design
- Verify all components work well across screen sizes
- Fix any responsive design issues
- Ensure consistent spacing and layout

### 4.3 Form Handling
- Standardize form validation
- Improve error messaging for users
- Enhance form submission UX

## 5. Testing & Maintenance

### 5.1 Testing
- Add tests for critical components
- Ensure type safety with TypeScript
- Test error handling paths

### 5.2 Documentation
- Update comments for complex logic
- Document key architectural decisions
- Add README updates if needed

## Implementation Strategy

We'll work through this plan systematically, starting with code cleanup to establish a cleaner foundation, then moving through performance optimizations, architectural improvements, UX enhancements, and finally addressing testing and documentation needs.

Each task should be completed as a discrete unit of work, with clear before/after metrics where possible to measure improvements.
